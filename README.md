# Predicting-the-presence-of-Pulsar

Pulsars are a type of Neutron star with a very strong magnetic field and a high spin frequency; it is often difficult to distinguish legitimate signals from radio signal noise.
These Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular rotational periods that produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds .

The objective of this project was to identify the best classification method to analyze the problem of predicting a star from the dataset, prepared after pre-processing.
Also, I used R Shiny to create a user interactive app to display the analysis of different classification methods like Logistic Regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbors and Flexible Discriminant Analysis.

The final accuracy achieved for the prediction was 98.16% with a Kappa score of 0.88 using SVM as the classification method. The crucial part of the project was to cater to the problem of Class imbalance.
